Salmon Data
===========

Overview
--------

An experimental shiny application to allow CRUD operations on a local copy of the Spawning Ground (SG) database. Connections to the local DB rely on a dsn to ensure no credentials are leaked. This application is intended to serve a template for creating one-off standalone front-ends for individual groups needing customized access to the database. Hopefully, any applications stemming from this effort can serve as a simple bridge for biologists to gain access to our central database until a standardized nodejs angular solution is implemented.
