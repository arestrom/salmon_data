### Introduction 

This application is intended as a demonstration of a create, update, and delete (CRUD) application using the R programming language, the shiny web-appliction framework and PostgreSQL as a backend database. 

### Usage notes

Use this to update beach data to the shellfish beach tables. See if you can break it. And please keep notes (add to global.R) on anything that could use improvement.

### Next steps

Develop a more sophisticated version with collapsible sidebar and additional tabs for the new spawning_ground database.
