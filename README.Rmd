# Salmon Data

## Overview

An experimental shiny application to allow CRUD operations on a local copy of the Spawning Ground database (SG). Connections to the local DB rely on a dsn to ensure no credentials are leaked. This application is intended to serve a template for creating one-off standalone front-ends for individual groups needing customized access to the database. Hopefully, any applications stemming from this effort can serve as a simple bridge for biologists to gain access to our central database until a standardized nodejs angular solution is implemented.
